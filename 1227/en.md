# LOJ 1227 - Boiled Eggs

**[Problem](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1227):** You are given **n** eggs. In one trial, you need to boil the maximum number of eggs. You cannot take more than **P** eggs and the total weight of the eggs cannot be more than **Q** gm.

_Time limit: 500 ms_

_Input starts with an integer `T` (≤ 100), denoting the number of test cases._

_Each case starts with three integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `P` (1 ≤ P ≤ 30) and `Q` (1 ≤ Q ≤ 30). The next line contains n positive integers (not greater than 10) in non-descending order. These integers denote the weight of the eggs in gm._

**O(n^2) Approach:** We can store the weight of each egg in an array of size n and run two for loops to calculate all possible answers. Among them, we need to print the maximum one. This approach will take O(n) space and O(n^2) time.

**O(n) Approach:** As in the input the weight of each egg will be given in non-decreasing order, there is no need to store their values in an array and sort them. We can use a sum variable and keep adding the weight of each egg to the sum variable until it exceeds **Q**. We need a counter variable to keep track of the number of eggs taken so far until it exceeds **P**. In the end, we need to print the value of the counter variable. This approach will take O(1) space and O(n) time.

            for(int j = i; j < n; j++){
                if(counter + 1 <= P && sumOfWeight + a[j] <= Q) { // counter+1<=P ensures that number of eggs never exceeds P. sumOfWeight+x<=Q ensures that total weight of eggs never exceeds Q
